          <p className="text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto text-[#62483a]">
            The art world has long been shaped by individuals whose vision,
            passion, and patronage elevate them beyond mere collectors to become
            true luminaries. These exceptional figures not only acquire
            masterpieces but foster artistic movements, nurture emerging talent,
            and preserve cultural heritage for future generations. At
            Collectico, our Luminary membership draws inspiration from these
            influential patrons whose legacies transcend ownership to become
            integral threads in art's evolving narrative.

                      transformed her passion for Renaissance art into a
                      cultural institution that continues to inspire. Her
                      methodical curation of European masterpieces alongside

                      understanding of art's historical continuum.

                      Her prescient support of abstract expressionists and
                      surrealists fundamentally altered the course of
                      20th-century art.

                      exemplified how enlightened patronage can spark cultural

                      Michelangelo and Botticelli went beyond acquisition to
